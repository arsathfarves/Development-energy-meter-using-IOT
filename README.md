During the ongoing time period the need of power i.e., electricity is growing exponentially due to the rapid usage of various technologies present around us. Due to this it has been a matter of worry for the developing and developed countries for need of rapid power outages. Solution for this was inferred as buyers and individuals to monitor their daily usage in their respective places. The project emphasizes on Smart Metering to ensure a cleaner and efficient transmission of power depending upon one’s use and to provide a sustainable development. The meters used since the starting of era don’t provide enough data for the buyer to be aware of the usage and what to or how to monitor the usage. Smart Meter helps the buyers to monitor them time to time usage and to remotely access their respective loads from anywhere. This project helps in obtaining a newer form of approach to the buyers to help them reduce the cost of usage of power and to help in sustainable development. In addition, we have implemented an IoT system to monitor the use of each load so that the user can track daily energy consumption with the appropriate load.
